			<h2><a href="#">What, what, what are you doing?</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">By, <a href="#">Trevor Boeckman</a></span>
			<p>This week has been dubbed "A" week by...someone. I'm not exactly sure how it started, but the movement has gained traction on Facebook. The idea is this: change your profile picture to an "A" for the week to come out and show how many atheists there are on Facebook.

The principle behind the event is a good one. When you can create an "us" vs. "them" mentality, it's really easy to demonize another group. When you realize "them" are your neighbors, friends, and family, it becomes a lot harder. Harvey Milk, advocating for gay rights, is portrayed in a memorable "Milk" scene saying "if they know us, they don't vote against us." The same is true of bringing atheism to the mainstream. If they know us, they don't vote against us.

So, it should be a powerful movement when I see this on Facebook, right?

			<p>Well, it would be -- except here are what the people we're trying to win over are saying:</p>
			
			<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jpC2bdAc2is/TYfvyQHxzHI/AAAAAAAAAOw/cyQZNPzcF-w/s1600/andrea+chat.PNG" />
			
			<p>No one outside of our movement knows what the "A" means. Yes, some people will look up what's going on. Most won't.

Want to actually help help with the movement? Grab a sheet of paper, write that you're an atheist, and make that your profile picture. Hell, give us a link to it. Lets put these pictures around campus! Lets make a video! Lets actually out ourselves and show this campus how many atheists they know. A symbol is nice. A face is better.

Seriously, lets do this. Don't have a camera? Markers? A pen? My phone number is in the contact page. Send me a text and I'll bring them to you. Let me kick this off. This is what an atheist looks like.

			<h2><a href="#">Announcing UNIFI's Vice President for 2011-2012</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">By, <a href="#">Cory Derringer</a></span>
			<p>I want to start by thanking Trevor for appointing me as the next UNIFI President. It's been a pleasure working under and learning from Trevor for the last two years, and I hope next year we can take the group he revolutionized to even greater heights.</p>

			<p>I'm writing this post to announce a change in the makeup of the officer core for next year. The relationship between each of the positions has in the past been left undefined: everyone answered to the president. This accomplished two things: it allowed the group a certain flexibility, and it took advantage of Trevor's considerable leadership abilities.</p>

			<p>Next year, I want the officer core to be led by a President-Vice President team. In essence, I'm expanding the role of Vice President. Because the Vice President will be more involved in decision making and have more authority than in the past, I have decided to select this officer first so that he/she may be involved in the selection of the other three officers and the revitalized chair positions, as well as the development of any other structural changes to the officer core. (I'll publish a post with more detail when the applications become available in the near future.)</p>

			<p>With that said, I have selected my Vice President for next year: Michael Dippold.</p>

			<p>I am confident both in the decision to change the relationship between the Vice President and the rest of the officer core, and the selection I have made for the position. If anyone has questions about this process or suggestions for next year, I urge you to email me at cory@unifreethought.com.</p>

			<p>Congratulations, Mr. Dippold. I look forward to working with you, and I am confident in our ability to continue to make steady progress for UNIFI in the year to come.</p>

			<h2><a href="#">Announcing UNIFI's Next President</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">By, <a href="#">Trevor Boeckman</a></span>
			<p>For the past two years, I've had the honor of serving as UNIFI's President. I've been proud of the work that I've accomplished along with our officers and members. We've started something great with this group, and I have no doubt it will continue in the coming years.</p>
			
			<p>However, it won't continue with me. This May, I'll be graduating and moving to attend law school. Our constitution gives the President the power to appoint a successor every year on March 15th. The newly appointed President will spend a month organizing next year's leadership and then, on April 15th, will officially take over the group.</p>
			
			<p>I am honored to announce the appointment of UNIFI's next President: Cory Derringer.</p>
			
			<p>Cory has served as my Vice President for the past two years and is one of the most dedicated, knowledgeable, and hard-working members of the group. I have suspected from the day I became President that he would be my successor. Cory has been responsible for the creation of Faith Forum, the re-vitalization of the blog, and the STAR program at Cedar Falls High School. He organized  this year's Darwin Week faculty speakers and was an excellent partner is our Darwin Week debate. I'm excited to see Cory continue to develop collaborative events with religious groups on campus -- it's an area where he excels, and I'm, admittedly, a bit lackluster.</p>
			
			<p>Want to be a part of the new Derringer administration? Over the next few weeks, be on the lookout for announcements on how to be a part of next year's leadership team. Feel free to contact Cory with any questions.</p>
			
			<p>Again, congratulations Cory. I've loved having you as my Vice President, and I look forward to seeing what you'll do with the new job.</p>
